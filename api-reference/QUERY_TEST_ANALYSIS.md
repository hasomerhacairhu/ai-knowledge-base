## Edge Cases & Limitations

### What Works Well ✅
1. Specific entity queries ("Who was X?", "What is Y?")
2. Topic-based searches ("Holocaust lesson plans")
3. Multilingual queries (tested English + Hungarian)
4. Educational resource discovery
5. Historical event queries

### Potential Challenges ⚠️
1. **Abstract/philosophical queries** - May need LLM interpretation
2. **Comparative analysis** - "Compare X and Y" better with LLM
3. **Synthesis across documents** - Gets chunks, not synthesized answer
4. **No citations in text** - Gets relevant chunks, not formatted citations

### When to Switch Methods
- Need synthesized answer → Use Quick Query or Full Featured
- Need all sources → Use Full Featured
- Need analysis/comparison → Use Quick Query with LLM

## Cost Analysis

### Direct Search Cost Model

**Fixed Pricing:**
- $2.50 per 1,000 searches
- $0.0025 per query
- No token costs
- No LLM overhead

**9 Test Queries Cost:**
- 9 queries × $0.0025 = **$0.0225**

**Projected Monthly Costs (1000 queries/month):**
