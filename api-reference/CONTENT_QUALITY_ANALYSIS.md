## Test 3: "Ki volt Koltai István?" (Hungarian)

### Quick Query (LLM Answer - in Hungarian) ⚡
```
Koltai István egy zsidó családból származott, 1907-ben született Koltán. 
Gyerekkorában a családja vallásos volt, de ő és testvérei később 
eltávolodtak a vallástól. István nem járt nyilvános iskolába, mert nem 
volt zsidó iskola, ezért jesivába tanult. A második világháború alatt 
került munkaszolgálatra, és élete végéig kommunista volt.

A házasságát követően Egerben élt, ahol osztályvezetőként ment nyugdíjba. 
1980-ban hunyt el.
```

**Translation:**
```
Koltai István came from a Jewish family, born in 1907 in Kolta. In his 
childhood, his family was religious, but he and his siblings later distanced 
themselves from religion. István didn't attend public school because there 
was no Jewish school, so he studied in a yeshiva. During WWII, he was taken 
for forced labor service and remained a communist for the rest of his life.

He died in 1980.

```
Koltai István – Panni férje

A férjem Greiner Izidornak született. Aztán 1946-ban Koltai Istvánra 
magyarosított. Valamikor Koltán laktak, és mikor rákérdeztek a háború 
után, hogy hogy akarja magyarosítani, azt mondta, Koltaira. Kérdezték 
sokszor tőle, hogy a Koltai XY rokon-e neki, azt mondta, igen, ha 
azelőtt Greiner volt.

Ugyanabban az utcában laktak a Greinerék, a férjemék, mint mi.

Én bírtam őt nagyon, mert okos fiú volt. Nem a legszebb volt, de 
nagyon okos volt, és én szerettem tanulni...
```

**Translation:**
```
Koltai István – Panni's husband

My husband was born as Izidor Greiner. Then in 1946 he Hungarianized 
his name to István Koltai. They once lived in Kolta, and when asked 
after the war how he wanted to Hungarianize it, he said Koltai. They 
often asked him if Koltai XY was related to him, he said yes, if he 
was previously Greiner.

The Greiners, my husband's family, lived on the same street as us.

I liked him very much because he was a smart boy. He wasn't the most 
handsome, but he was very smart, and I loved to learn...
